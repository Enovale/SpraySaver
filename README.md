# Spray Saver

Lethal Company mod to save spray paint decals to the save file.

# Features

- 

# Info

This mod is intended to be used with [BetterSprayPaint](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/taffyko/BetterSprayPaint/),
but will work without it.

This mod will also greatly inflate your save file size (Up to a maximum of ~2MB with BSP and a high decal limit),
this is just the nature of the amount of data being saved.

# Known Issues

- Multiple cruisers at the same time aren't handled well (or at all)
- Decal weathering currently destroys decals inside the cruiser but it shouldn't (So long as the door it shut)
- This mod will usually end up eating the entire decal limit by itself, which maybe should be mitigated somehow
